description: How to use Assistant Relay Cast

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

With Version 4 of Assistant Relay, we decided to make a change to how the casting functionality works.

As we utilise CATT, we removed the cast API complexity, and now allow users to send any command to CATT by passing the
full CATT command to the API.

It is possible to cast media from [several hundred](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html) sites

To start casting, send a HTTP POST request to `/api/cast/catt` with the following json-encoded body parameter:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="json"
  values={[
    { label: 'JSON', value: 'json', },
    { label: 'Schema', value: 'schema', },
    { label: 'Response', value: 'response', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="json">

```json
{
	"command": "catt -d \"Kitchen Hub\" cast https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xSxXiHwMrg", // catt command
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="schema">

```
command: STRING
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="response">

```json
{
    "success": true
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once the media has finished playing, the cast will automatically close
