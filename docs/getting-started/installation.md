> TODO: Finalise Pre-Requistes

At its core, Assistant Relay is powered by Node.js
## Pre-Requisites
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version >= 10.13.0 (this can be checked by running `node -v`). If you require 
multiple Node versions, you can use [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage multiple versions on a single machine.
* [CATT](https://github.com/skorokithakis/catt) Assistant Relay no longer installs CATT automatically due to different user
environment variables. It will need to be installed before Assistant Relay is installed.
* [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) will be installed as a pre-requisite. If you do not already have it installed, please install after Node.js by running `npm i pm2 -g`
* [Assistant Relay](https://github.com/greghesp/assistant-relay/releases) - Make sure you download the latest **release.zip**.  Do not download the Source Code!
