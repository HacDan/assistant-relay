Assistant Relay Cast is powered by [CATT](https://github.com/skorokithakis/catt)
and allows you to send videos from many online sources such as YouTube, Vimeo and hundreds of others to your Chromecast, Smart Displays and Speakers.  It also allows you to cast local files and render websites

## Searching for devices

To send a cast command, you need to know the device name or IP address.  To get these, Assistant Relay utilises the `CATT scan` command to return an object of your available devices.

To do this, send a HTTP POST request to `/cast/search` and you will get a result like below:

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "devices": [
        {
            "address": "192.168.1.9",
            "name": "Living Room"
            "model": "Google Nest Hub",
            "uuid": "a123456-78aa-abc34-123456abcdef"
        },
        {
            "address": "192.168.1.182",
            "name": "Living Room Speaker",
            "model": "Google Home Mini",
            "uuid": "a123456-78aa-abc34-123456abcdef"
        },
        {
            "address": "192.168.1.11",
            "name": "Office Hub",
            "model": "Google Nest Hub Max",
            "uuid": "a123456-78aa-abc34-123456abcdef"
        }
    ]
}
```
